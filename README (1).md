# A GIS-Based Analysis of Health Facility Distribution and Population Coverage in Wakiso District, Uganda”

## Description:
This project involves a GIS-based analysis of health facility distribution in relation to population density in Wakiso District, Uganda. The objective is to identify underserved areas and assess whether the distribution of health facilities aligns with population needs.


## Objective of the Analysis:
- Map the spatial distribution of health facilities (by type and ownership)
- Analyze population density across villages in Wakiso
- Determine facility-to-population ratios
- Identify geographic gaps in service delivery to inform decision-making



## Software and Tools Used:
- QGIS (version 3.40.7) – for spatial analysis, mapping, and GeoPackage management
- Microsoft Excel – for project log tracking and attribute table editing
- UBOS GIS Portal – for administrative boundaries and population data
- HMIS / Ministry of Health – for health facility data
- Notepad  – for documentation
- Microsoft Word- report writing
